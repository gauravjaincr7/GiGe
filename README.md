# GiGe-Give and Get
GiGe is a platform for sharing goods and services among students using point system. It is an ecosystem that thrives on people helping each other.
Points can be purchased as well as earned. People can upload "gives" and "gets" which are the way of changing points. 
In get, you spend points by getting some item and in give, you earn points by giving your items to people.
You can change the location from My Campus to My City to allow any student from your city to see your gives and so they can use it. 
We also have a chat feature so you can chat with the person who you are giving to or getting from. Also when you buy a "get" your points are deducted after you pick up the item from the giver. The pickup address is mentioned in the give and you can chat and get to know specifics and set the time and other things
The giver can set the time for which they want to lend the item, and they can also add the points they required to buy the "get".
